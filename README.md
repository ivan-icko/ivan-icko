# Hi, I'm Ivan Stepanović

I’m a **Full‑Stack Developer** with a strong **backend focus**, driven by building resilient, scalable systems.  
With **4+ years of professional experience**, I’ve worked across multiple stacks including **NestJS**, **PHP (Laravel)**, **C#**, and **Java**, building production‑grade applications and backend architectures.

### Tech & Tools  
```ts
Backend  : NestJS · Node.js · PHP (Laravel) · C# · Java · TypeORM · PostgreSQL · MySQL · Redis
Frontend : React · Next.js · TailwindCSS · Vite  
DevOps   : Docker · GitLab CI/CD · Traefik · Railway · AWS · Supabase · NGINX
Testing  : Jest · Supertest · TDD/BDD  
Other    : RabbitMQ · Elasticsearch / OpenSearch · Clean Code · Serverless patterns
```

### Selected Projects  
- **init** – My very first GitHub project, built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — full of beginner mistakes I now keep proudly as a reminder of where it all started.
- **appointment‑backend** – A TypeScript/NestJS backend service for managing appointments, featuring clean architecture, and relational database logic.  
- **appointment‑frontend** – Matching frontend built with Next.js/React, showcasing full‑stack delivery and modern UI patterns.  
- **url‑transformer** – TypeScript utility for reusable, type‑safe URL parsing and transformation logic.

### What I’m Doing Now  
- Architecting and maintaining backend services for high‑traffic applications  
- Exploring **system design principles**, scalability patterns, and distributed architectures  
- Deep‑diving into **serverless Node.js**, **document databases**, and **search engines** like Elasticsearch / OpenSearch  
- Building modern full‑stack experiences with **Next.js 15** and **Supabase SSR authentication**  
- Writing clean, maintainable, and test‑driven code
